# Dataset Ingestion Workflow For Modified TMDB Dataset

This workflow can ingest [TMDB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) into ApertureDB.
In addition to persisting all the information of the dataset, the ingestion depicts how to build on top of the original data by adding more features (like posters).

Further, it maintains the information as a knowledge graph, which can be queried and visualised in some interesting ways to make it useful.
